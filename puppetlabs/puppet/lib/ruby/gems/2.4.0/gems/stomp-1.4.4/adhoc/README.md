# The Ruby stomp Gem - Adhoc Items #

This directory will contain a variety of artifacts.

It is envisioned that content will mostly be of interest to gem developers.
However gem clients may find items of interest here as well.

## Issue 121 ##

Much of the initial work in this directory has focused on
recreating / confirming the high memory use described in
[issue 121](https://github.com/stompgem/stomp/issues/121).

Resolution of that issue is TDB (2016.05.25).
